# Cascading comboboxes

if you have dorop down lists (combo boxes) where the second drop down list shall show different values based on the selection of the first one, this example show you how to achieve that.

The logic can be expanded to more than two comboboxes.

The default.ps1 contains the custom implementation of the InitializeWindows function. You can implement such function where you like, but as this is a function delivered with the standard, we prefer creating a file with the same name as the standard in order to identify that in such file, you will find the functions which overwrites the standards.
